# **Hubris Engine:** <small><sub>_A needle under the steps of giants._</sub></small>
## Introduction:
This is a rewrite of Sphynx Engine (Now renamed to Hubris Engine) to be better structured and more modular.
This implementation aims to be more flexible, easier to work with and upgradable with ease. 

Currently targeting C++20. Hubris will migrate to C++26 as soon as compiler and library support are stable.

*The engine is still in development and is not ready for use.*
## Planned Features:
- An open scripting API.
- Scripting using C#.
- Multi-threaded rendering.
- OpenUSD support.
- OpenGL, Vulkan, DX12 and D11 support. (Current focus is on Vulkan)
- A plugin system.
## Requirements:
- Vulkan SDK
- Cmake 3.12 (or above)
- C++20
- vcpkg
